Gunpowder,,"Gunpowder, Assagao",,,,N/A,,,,,,,,(+918322268229),"Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad...everyone pipe down. The best food is really not in your city. It’s all in Goa! Or so we think at least though Delhi and Mumbai come a close second! So, if you are heading to Goa for the first time, or the 50th time, this list is for you. With restaurants like Martin’s that have been around for decades, to the new kids on the block like Tamil Table, and those like Gunpowder are just unmissable, here’s the Ultimate Guide To Restaurants In Goa, across all cuisines, budgets and locations. If you fall in the category of “Visiting Goa For The 51st Time” please leave us a comment with your favourite eatery, and we’ll be happy to add it to this list!PS: There's a whopping 44 restaurants (FORTY-FOUR RESTAURANTS GUYS! ) for you to visit, so make sure to plan to stay at least a couple of weeks if not a month in Goa to do visit every restaurant on this list."
Chef Peter's Kitchen,,"Chef Peter's Kitchen, Pilerne",,,,"INR 1,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918805145181),"No trip to North Goa is complete without a meal at the hugely popular Gunpowder. They have a spread that's enough for both vegetarians and meat and seafood aficionados. It's inside a compound of a Portuguese style heritage house and it's as pretty as it can get. When it comes to the food, there's our favourite the Andhra-style Prawns, the Kodava Pandi Curry, and the Kerala Beef Fry. We are also very partial towards the Potato Stew and the Malabar Parotta. Sol Kadi for drinks and the panna cotta for dessert."
Juju - Reimagined Indian,,"Juju - Reimagined Indian, Colva",,,,"INR 1,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918956691430),"You might not know this but Chef Peter was awarded the Best Chef of India by the Department of Tourism in the non-hotel category and that's just the testament to the meal you get at his namesake restaurant. The restaurant is iconic for its authentic, home-style Goan-Portuguese food and pork vindaloos, potato recheado, and the chicken cafreal have left us dreaming about them to date. You'll polish off every last bit of food on the plate. Oh, and whatever you eat and how much ever you eat, be sure to make space for the Serradura which is a sweet, milky Portuguese pudding with biscuits."
Vinayak Family Restaurant,,"Vinayak Family Restaurant, Assagao",,,,N/A,,,,,,,,(+919049380518),"If you're always looking to try different things, check out Juju - Reimagined Indian. A fine dining restaurant specialising in modern Indian cuisine, you get to have the creations of celebrity Chef Avinash Martins, and drinks from world-class bartender Evgenya Prazdnik—all in the elevated interiors done by Samiir Wheaton."
Pousada By The Beach,,"Pousada By The Beach, Calangute",,,,INR 650 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+919922279265),"A local’s recommendation for a thali joint in North Goa, Vinayak is a home-style restaurant run by a Goan family. The fish thali is an absolute delight and will mostly feature the fresh catch of the day, along with portions of local veggies and clams. You can also check with them for the daily specials  — all of which will be one or the other delicious local Goan curry. Their Fish Xacuti, Prawn Rawa Fry and Prawn Sorpotel are among our favourites."
Hospedaria Venite,,"Hospedaria Venite Restaurant & Bar, Panjim",,,,"INR 3,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919850467008),"Located on the quieter and lesser frequented beach strip between Calangute and Baga, Pousada By The Beach is a serene and peaceful place to sit and enjoy personalised service, impressive food and refreshing drinks. While the place has a simplistic vibe to it, their daytime menu is bona fide fine-dining. Their Prawn Cocktail is among the best you’ll taste in Goa, and we also recommend their Grilled Fish, tangy Pork Vindaloo and a spicy Pork Xacuti."
The Black Sheep Bistro,,"The Black Sheep Bistro, Panjim",,,,"INR 1,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919325023565),"Located in a 200-year-old building, that has these cute balconies overlooking the narrow inner lanes of Panjim, Hotel Venite is a traveller’s delight. What is now only a restaurant, used to be a hotel brimming with hippies, from Goa’s early days — a wall full of scribbles and graffiti stands witness to the same, while the flooring is made out of timber salvaged from old Portuguese shipwrecks! Their mojitos and LIIT is quite #lit and we’d recommend the Stuffed Crabs and the Bombay Duck Fry."
Baba Au Rhum,,"Baba Au Rhum, Anjuna",,,,"INR 1,500 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919822866366),"One of Panjim’s most-loved restaurants, The Black Sheep Bistro has pledged its allegiance to the farm-to-table concept. They are known to experiment with flavours and constantly bring in new dishes to celebrate seasonal produce. So, among bestsellers like the Pork Chop and Barley and the Red Kismur Fish Fillet, you’ll also see Risotto made without rice, featuring akur bhaji (that’s a lot like asparagus) and crisped up slices of Goan bread. There’s also the Spicy Chocolate Spaghetti and to round it all up, and Chocolate Salami."
Kokni Kanteen,,"Kokni Kanteen, Panjim",,,,"INR 1,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918322421972),"Combining the best of both worlds, Baba Au Rhum is a part traditional French cafe, part Goan fusion food. Run by two French peeps, their croissants, fruit salads and pizzas are very popular with the local community. Tucked away from the main road, the cafe overlooks lush paddy fields and is one of the best breakfast/brunch places around. And if you’re a steak person, they offer some of the best medium to medium-rare steaks you’ll find in Goa."
Burger Factory,,"Burger Factory, Anjuna",,,,INR 750 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+919075640690),"There’s a reason why people (tourists and locals alike) make a beeline for this Panjim gem. Kokni Kanteen no-fuss restaurant has the friendliest staff and an adorably vintage feel to it. Everyone who’s after authentic Goan food needs to land up here for their fill of one of the best Fish Thali, Prawn Rawa Fry, Mussels or Tisra. And while the seafood is all too good, It’d be criminal to leave without having their signature Serradura."
Thalassa,,"Thalassa, Siolim",,,,INR 900 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+919850033537),"There’s something deeply comforting about a well-made burger and this ever-so-popular join in Anjuna and Morjim understands that. Now, whether you’re a Goa newbie or a regular who’s somehow missed out, make sure you include Burger Factory in your vacay plans for you’re unlikely to find that sort of bacon and cheeseburger and double cheddar and pork burgers anywhere else in Goa. The milkshakes are a hug to a tired, hungover soul and the fries, are to die for!"
The Fisherman's Wharf,,"The Fisherman's Wharf, Panjim",,,,"INR 2,100 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918888493333),"Almost a rite of passage for anyone who's been to Goa once or many times - catching a meal, the sunset, or saying 'Opa' at Thalassa. The legendary place is located in Siolim, along the backwaters, and it's as pretty as it can get. The menu is a Greek and Mediterranean affair and some of the best you can eat. Be sure to order the Mediterranean Prawn Platter and the Steamed Mussels in Ouzo Sauce. If you prefer meat, the Greek Chicken Pizza and Beef Souvlakis are a must-try. Oh, lest we forget, the Pork Gyros are simply the best."
Olive Bar & Kitchen,,"Olive Bar & Kitchen, vagator, Vagator",,,,"INR 1,100 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+917888037772),"With multiple locations in Goa, The Fisherman's Wharf in Cavelossim is our favourite -- it's by the banks of River Sal and it's set in a typical Portuguese house setting. For anyone who's never had Recheado, Cafreal or Xacuti, the Wharf is the best place to have your first try. The flavours are all authentic with the masalas all freshly prepared. Of course, with such a name, you know you are in for a seafood treat. The King Prawn Recheado, Pomfret in Butter Garlic Sauce and the Prawn Curry Rice are our regular orders. Throw in Chicken Cafreal and Chorizo Pao and you've got yourself a meal fit for royalty. Finish off your meal with Bebinca."
Bhatti Village,,"Bhatti Village Family Restaurant & Bar, Nerul",,,,"INR 2,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919822184103),"Olive Bar & Kitchen comes with a beautiful beach view that you can enjoy while sipping on their signature sangria. The menu is expansive and a mix of Greek and Goan flavours. There's a Mezze Platter that comes with warm poi and the Beef Carpaccio is our go-to order. If it's available, do order the Tiger Prawns Per Per. Jaggery Cheesecake to finish off your meal. Of course, you can stay here the whole day with lounge beds and showers available, should you wish to go for a dip."
Tamil Table,,"Tamil Table, Assagao",,,,INR 500 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+917499922517),"Bhatti Village is a hidden gem that's set inside a classic Goan home. It's a family-run restaurant and all the meals are homestyle. Seafood fare rage supreme here but with homemade feni and ox tongue delicacies, you are in for a gastronomic treat. Go for the fresh catch of the day but whatever you order, there needs to be at least one portion of Tisryo Masala and Whitebait Fry. Binda Sol/Amsol and Clams Masala are your next set of orders. Their beef fry and ox tongue roast are worth trying. It goes without saying that the menu is heavy on meat."
Mahe - Modern Coastal Cuisine,,"Mahe - Modern Coastal Cuisine, Anjuna",,,,"INR 1,500 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919765874858),"Yet another sprawling Portuguese home in Assagao makes way for a classy and elegant restaurant. The serene surroundings and tasteful interiors beckon diners immediately. This one serves contemporary Tamil cuisine and the innovative cocktails like Guava Mary and Curry leaf G&T, are an added charm. The Pork Belly Chettinadu and Coconut milk pulao are absolutely worth sampling. This place is fast becoming a staple in the Goa dining scene."
Martin's Corner,,"Martin's Corner, Betalbatim, Salcete",,,,"INR 1,400 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918322880413),Mahe is a modern coastal cuisine fine dining restaurant that will leave you craving for more. Flavours are on point and simple and have interesting options even for vegetarians. Try the Aubergine Recheado that's served with poi and a hung curd dip -- you'll probably end up ordering another round. The Tapioca Bravas will take you to flavour town while the Slow Cooked Mackerel will make you want to live in the town forever. Do try the Sri Lankan Mutton Curry for something more substantial and keep space for the Pradhaman Panna Cotta.
Bomras,,"Bomras, Candolim",,,,"Meal For Two:  INR 1,500 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919767591056),"Martin’s Corner Goa is an institution with the finest Goan food you can get in the sunshine state! Or so we think! While they have Chinese, other Indian, and what they call Global Cuisine, skip straight to Goan specials.Close your eyes and order Chilli Beef, Calamari, Masala Fry and Goan Pork Sausages. Fish Curry or Prawn Curry and rice is the most delicious and simple meal that gets Goa home food on point. With that hint of coconut, hit of spice and fresh fish, you can’t go wrong. Pork Vindaloo and Prawn Balchao in homemade Recheado masala are also proper stars. Vegetarians, the cauliflower Caldin is apparently very good, but we confess we have not had any vegetarian food here. Desserts range from Tiramisu and cheesecakes to Caramel Custard and ice creams, but why bother when there’s authentic Serradura. The only downside to Martin’s Corner is that when it’s crowded, service takes ages, and sometimes the quality of the food dips."
O Coqueiro,,"O Coqueiro, Alto Porvorim, Penha De Franca",,,,"Meal For Two: INR 3,000 without alcohol, but it’s Bomras, and it’s worth it!",,,,,,,,(+918322417806),"Go to Bomras for slightly experimental food that is a mix of Burmese and the rest of Asia food. The menu is small but covers a lot of ground between meats, seafood and veggies along with fresh flavours and textures. But definitely start with the house-special salad - pickled tea leaf salad, Lah Pet Tok, which is tossed up with lots of dried shrimp and a generous drizzle of fish sauce. There is also a veggie option.The crispy pork belly is another favourite, but don’t eat too many starters. Leave room for mains and dessert! We recommend the Banana Leaf Wrapped fish and the Bomras Chilli Chicken (made with kokum, mushroom, black basil and Madras onions) are our picks. For dessert, chocolate and carrot blondie are to die for. Especially since it comes with a divine dark chocolate sorbet! YUM! Check out their specials on Sundays. The last time we went around, there was a special Khow Suey menu."
Cota Cozinha,,"Cota Cozinha, Betalbatim",,,,"INR 1,600 without alcohol(as of 16/11/2021, O Coqueriro was closed because of the storm warning. They should open by December)",,,,,,,,(+918322880031),"A casual dining restaurant in Alto Porvorim (North Goa), the Portuguese Goan restaurant is a must-visit for anyone on a culinary journey in Goa. What started out as a tiny, rustic kitchen back in the ’60s with a fantastic Chicken Cafreal now offers various authentic, Goan fare. The airy restaurant features rustic architecture and interiors with a contemporary feel. The must-tries (apart from the Chicken Cafreal) include the Stuffed Crab, the Xacutis, their beef options, and alcohol-infused desserts! The best ways to experience O Coqueriro is either during live screenings of sporting events or during one of their regular food festivals known to throw light on different aspects of Goan cuisine."
Zeebop,,"Zeebop, Utorda, Salcete",,,,"INR 1,800 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918322755333),"Tucked in the quieter sections of Betalbatim, Cota Cozinha has a warmth lent by its wooden cottage setting and hanging ceiling lanterns. This place is one of the best restaurants in South Goa and for good reason. You get a delectable spread, from Goan and North-Indian to Continental and Chinese. We hear their Sausage Stuffed Calamari is all the rage and also their Stuffed Squid and Chicken Cafreal make it to the favourites list. Go for their Prawn Recheado with naan if you’re in for a spicy treat. The restaurant has plenty of options for vegetarians as well, be it Chinese or local Goan food! Pair your food with alcohol (can’t get better, can it?) as you enjoy the calm outside and round off your meal with their Banoffee Pie."
Babka,,"Babka, Anjuna",,,,"Meal For Two: INR 1,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918262041326),"Arguably one of the most famous shacks in Goa, Zeebop draws people from all over Goa. If you want to do away with crowded spots, Zeebop offers the perfect setting with its quaint and basic sea-view seating and delicious seafood. Ask them for the fresh catch of the day and the staff comes carrying the seafood for you to pick. You can choose the preparation (in garlic/lemon butter or Recheado crumb fried) and relax. Their Tandoori sea-food selection is highly sought after, namely their Tandoori Pomfret and Fish Tikkas which you can pair with a pint of beer. They have north-Indian curries for vegetarians but their seafood is why we suggest you pay a visit here. Finish your meal with their famous matka kulfis."
A Reverie,,"A Reverie, Calangute",,,,"Meal For Two: INR 1,200 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919823174927),"If you’ve searched long and hard to find good coffee in Goa, the search ends at Babka in Anjuna. This cafe is a mood by itself, be it the graffiti on the walls, the simple furniture or the plants hanging out of various lights and decor accents. Try their Vietnamese Cold Brew or their classic cold coffee and pair it up with their Smoked Salmon Bagel. You could also pick from their selection of quiches from the display shelves to go with your coffee. Their food menu isn’t extensive but what you get is totally worth it. The cafe has multiple charging points and wi-fi throughout the space so you can lounge in peace. However, if you’re on the go, you can pick up your coffee and head right out!"
Chafe Braz,,"Chafe Braz, Panaji",,,,"INR 3,000. You will have to pay big to eat here, if you aren't very excited by the sound of this, reserve this spot for special occasions or for when your palate has had enough of Goan curries.",,,,,,,,(+918322431900),"Bookmark A Reverie in Calangute for when you want to enjoy fancy fare in a fancy (quiet, outdoor) setting at dinnertime (they open for service only in the evenings and are shut on Tuesdays). This fine-dining restaurant aims to disrupt the norms of everyday dining with a menu that is experimental to the point of featuring several molecular gastronomy recipes. What's also interesting is that change is the only constant here, with a new menu highlighting seasonal ingredients introduced every fortnight or so. We've read stellar reviews of everything they've served thus far, but the tapas or small plates are most sought after. Other must-tries include Chorizo Baos, Wasabi and Guac Tacos, House Aged Fillet Steak and Miso Chilli Tofu Steak. The 'Eggs, but no Eggs!' dessert menu is quite the crowd-pleaser too"
Lush By The Cliff,,"Lush By The Cliff, Anjuna",,,,INR 800 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+918010993209),"A jazz room and a cafe that serves lesser-known Indo-Portuguese dishes, Cháfé Braz truly brings together two of Goa's most loved facets - food and live music. The story goes that this spot located in the heart of Panjim opened in honour of Goa’s most talented musician Braz Gonsalves, and continues to pay tribute and provide a platform to all Goan artists. While the jazz room is lively with elaborate wall murals and is always busy, the cafe is intimate and cosy and has alfresco seating too. Just before or after enjoying a lovely live music session, preferably jazz, get yourself and company plates of delicious Almofadas De Carne (Beef Pockets), Prawn Pie or Apa De Camarão, or the crowd favourite Rissóis De Camarão (Shrimp Turnovers) and for dessert, Serradura or the Portuguese sawdust pudding."
Sakana,,"Sakana, vagator, Vagator",,,,INR 800 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+919890135502),"Stunning views of the sunset (or sunrise), favourite cocktail in hand and scrumptious nibbles will keep you company at Lush By The Cliff, one of North Goa's most beloved spots to chill at. Perched on a cliff by Anjuna beach, this resto-bar is forever bustling and on certain days makes you wait for the perfect sea-facing seat in the house, but it's all worth it. We hear the service is prompt and friendly too, plus your server will be happy to hook you up with drink and food recommendations. Definitely get yourself a cocktail, there are plenty of options and bases to pick from - tequila, gin, martini, rum, whiskey, vodka or feni based. The menu is largely multi-cuisine with continental, breakfast, Goan specials and Chinese as mainstays. It would be wise not to settle for a whole meal and instead order a bunch of appetisers like the Stuffed Mushrooms, Fish & Chips, Chicken Satay or Prawns Koliwada and Chicken Cafreal. No matter what you choose to do, blue skies, high tides and good vibes are guaranteed!"
Maka Zai,,"Maka Zai, Anjuna",,,,"INR 1,200 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919022099693),"Tired of the beach and looking for a change of scene? Check out Sakana, an authentic Japanese restaurant situated in Chapora Road, Vagator that serves you not just sushi rolls but also quiet garden feels. The interiors- a mix of brown and red are designed to make you feel relaxed and at ease. A great place to unwind and hang out with friends, Sakana offers a wide fare that includes dishes like sashimi and sushi to noodles and rice. A favourite and highly recommended dish would be the teriyaki chicken and miso soup. Offering great food in decent portions, a quiet atmosphere and not a hole in your pocket, Sakana is definitely worth a try."
Ritz Classic,,"Ritz Classic, Panjim",,,,"INR 1,400 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+918322426417),"This bright yellow corner restaurant in Anjuna announces its presence from a distance. Indoors, the seating is comfortable yet, simple, elegant. The air is redolent with comfort and a homely vibe. The Asian food is decidedly innovative, but with a Goan twist. The signature dish is a poee mashup with a bao called a baoee, stuffed with mince or Thai seafood. General Hans Drums of Hell, is surely worth trying. The playfulness in the cocktails is evident, as is the cutting-edge mixology. This one certainly is a place, which makes you say “I want” or Maka Zai in Konkani."
Cantare,,"Cantare, Saligao",,,,INR 800 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+917972548319),"Known for serving epic fish thalis, Café Ritz Bar and Restaurant sees guests pouring in from all the corners of the state. It's a great respite that they have multiple outlets across Porvorim, Panjim that are open from 11 am till 11 pm. This restaurant boasts of a menu that has mouth-watering local preparations of fish, prawns, shark, mussels, oysters, chicken, mutton and egg. There is a limited menu for vegetarians too but rest assured that everything that makes it to the table is drool-worthy. The best part about Ritz? It's budget-friendly (especially their thalis)."
Roboto,,"Roboto, Calangute",,,,INR 800 with alcohol,,,,,,,,(+918010831200),"Tucked in the interiors of Saligao, Cantare has been a favourite amongst locals and tourists for years now. This family-run restaurant has a lovely old-world vintage charm that lends a unique identity to this place. Great Goan and Thai cuisine make this restaurant a hot favourite. If you visit, don’t forget to order the Thai Red Curry, Beef Steak, Seafood Noodles and Pork Chops. For those who love music, Cantare comes highly recommended for live acts. Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays are reserved for jazz nights, while Thursdays and Sundays are for rock and roll. Wednesdays are dedicated to quiz nights."
Amavi By Sumera,,"Amavi, Calangute",,,,"INR 1,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+917378884087),"While on holiday, visiting a restaurant with great food and pretty interiors is always on my to-do list. And if you’re like me, looking for something pretty in Goa, then head to Roboto -- a Japanese and Korean restaurant situated in Calangute. Having opened its doors very recently, this pretty place serves a wide range of Japanese and Korean foods. K-Drama lovers, you are bound to find some delicious Korean Chicken wings and ramen while in Roboto. Along with its elegant interiors and open-air seating, Roboto also offers its guests karaoke nights every other weekend. So if you’re in the mood for a relaxed meal with live music and a great vibe, Roboto is the place to go."
Escobar,,"Esco Bar, Assagao",,,,"INR 2,000 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+917972818233),"Those of you chilling in and around Calangute, stroll into Amavi for their exhaustive menu that includes vegan, vegetarian, and non-vegetarian crowd-pleasing options. Known for their swish, modern decor and ambience, Amavi by Sumera is a stalwart in the Goan culinary scene. Calling themselves a “Chef centric restaurant”, you can bet the food is a work of gastronomical art.Featuring superbly plated global fare, we could wax poetic about all their offerings, but must-tries include Beef Medallions, Paella, Squid Rings, and Sea Bass. Vegetarians, feel free to order the plates of pasta and the Stir-Fried Tofu. What’s really cool is that the love for crafting food for you also involves ensuring that you savour it as much; every course is followed by locally inspired palate cleansers, making Amavi By Sumera an immersive experience that you must have in Goa."
Joseph's Bar,,"Joseph Bar, Panjim",,,,INR 800 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+918390665795),"Escobar in Assagao brings all the boys and girls to the yard. If you’re done with beer, try their kombucha cocktail (good for your gut and your spirit) and their flavoured Feni (hey ginger, hey masala). The rest of the bar menu is pretty regular with beer, gin, vodka, cocktails and the likes. They have cheesy fries, fish fingers, garlic bread and chicken cafreal with poi. And, we can tell you that the fries are addictive and sausage chilli is the perfect comfort food to go with the alcohol. The garlic bread slathered with a generous amount of butter and garlic was also demolished with equal ease. They open at 5 pm every evening and are around till about 11:30 pm on weekdays. On weekends, their doors are open till midnight."
Jamun,,"Jamun, Assagao",,,,INR 700 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+917823899945),"Joseph Bar is for those who are looking for something away from the usual tourist trap places. A local secret, Goans go here to this tiny joint to wash down fresh draft beer and chat with one of the most well-known servers, Gundo. There are only 10-15 seats, with a few tables and chairs spilling out onto the road. It isn’t known for its food, at most it has snacks available – beef or chicken samosas, fish cutlet or an egg or chicken dish. If you’re visiting during the summer months, you can also try a pint of arrack, a milder version of feni."
Ping's Bia Hoi,,"Ping's Bia Hoi, Sangolda",,,,"INR 1,500 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+917823888360),"With its telltale purple signboard and flower-adorned walls, Jamun is another Delhi-import that's opened its doors in Goa. The other is Ping's Bia Hoi (more on this later). The space is done up with elements from Goa -- think chandelier made from a collection of garrafaos and the balcao (balcony setting). The menu at Jamun is very Jamun-type -- ingredients from Goan kitchens fused with recipes from across Indian states so think of Tamatar Ki Chaat Stuffed Squids, Pork Chili Fry with Goan Chorizo, Crab Xec Xec and Prawn Pulao. Some Jamun Delhi favourites also make it to the menu -- Inspired Dahi Bhalla and Jamun’s Butter Chicken. For drinks, we recommend the Tamarind Margarita and Tefla Martini."
The Lazy Goose,,"The Lazy Goose, Candolim",,,,"INR 1,400 without alcohol.",,,,,,,,(+917775958419),"Delhi's popular Ping's Cafe Orient has found a permanent home in Goa called Ping's Bia Hoi, a spot that both locals and tourists have come to love. This Vietnamese beer garden meets Southeast Asian street food in Sangolda, North Goa is a peppy, kitschy, music-filled garden housed in Chef Picu's family home. The ambience is reminiscent of the streets and markets of Hanoi with a colourful barbershop kiosk, clothesline at the entrance, and big flower baskets. But it's the food and the freshly-brewed beer that has everyone talking. Favourites that you will order repeats of each time you are here are the Tapioca Pops perfect with a pint of chilled beer (special blends for Ping's Bia Hoi, freshly-brewed on tap by Bira, Goa Brewing Company, and Arbour Brewing Company), Philadelphia Cream Cheese Dim Sums, Sticky Pork Ribs, Red Chilli Clams and Tofu Bao. There are several options for vegetarians, including the classic Thai Curry. The cocktails here are just as ace as its Delhi counterpart, so make sure you try a few."
Mum's Kitchen,,"Mum's Kitchen, Panjim",,,,"INR 1,500 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+919822175559),"By the riverside, the Lazy Goose is known for its classic Goan seafood. The ambience leans into the riverside dining experience with old wooden boat displays, lots of natural lighting, and of course the breeze! The menu features an eclectic mix of cuisines, though Goan is what the spotlight is on, especially for seafood lovers. Their entire range of crab dishes (the mud crab options are the freshest in town!) and mangrove snapper with their in-house masala mix are must-tries. Vegetarians, unlike many other places in town, the Lazy Goose features Thai, Mediterranean and Continental options that hit the spot. We recommend the risotto and the polenta stacks. Wash it down with one of their signature cocktails, and you’ll wish you’d never have to leave!"
Saz On The Beach,,"Saz On The Beach, Morjim",,,,"INR 1,700 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+917030077170),"With over two and a half decades of delighting hungry customers from across the world, Mum’s Kitchen in Panjim lives up to its name in fame and spirit. The award winning restaurant (that has only around 10 tables!) celebrates traditional Goan flavours through household recipes, and of course mum’s love. Using fresh, local ingredients and recipes, techniques and knowledge passed down from the owners’ Rony Floriano and Maria Suzette’s mother Mum’s Kitchen is a labour of love. Enjoy classic (and the most authentic in town we hear) Goan fares like Xacuti and Prawn Curry with local bread or Pulao. The staff is happy to suggest wine pairings for meals as well. Their menu is exhaustive, and the ambience is calm and inviting. Do remember to make a reservation before heading there."
Miguel's,,"Miguel's - Cocktails & Petiscos, Panjim",,,,N/A,,,,,,,,(+919112222584),"Saz On The Beach is the latest import from Delhi (same folks behind Saz Delhi) and they will rival most beach view restaurants in Goa with their location that overlooks Morjim Beach. Open from 1 pm and all the way up to 1 am, we recommend you show up just after lunch so you can catch the sunset and then the whole night makes the place look even more beautiful. Canopy hang over the sofa and lounge seating. We are yet to try the menu but we've already spotted some interesting options to try -- Braised Beef Tongue Tacos, Saz Cubano, Black Pepper Crusted Chicken, and a Pan Sear Barramundi. For drinks, we are going with the Sun Saz & Feni. Meal for two: INR 1,400 without alcohol."

One cannot holiday in Goa without one drink., Keeping that in mind, we’ve found you a place in the capital of Goa, Panaji, that serves not just great alcohol but also delicious food. Miguel’s – Cocktails, and Pesticos is an art-deco bar that serves a mix of Goan and Portuguese food., Started by two university friends, Dhruv and Ankush, this bar spells cool with its, open kitchen and wide bar setup. With a limited menu for food, with a special one for, kids and a wide range of drinks, you will find yourself satiated after a meal, at Miguel’s."
Rice Mill,,"The Rice Mill, Morjim",,,,"INR 1,700 without alcohol",,,,,,,,(+917447473866),"Set inside a restored Goan house, all roads lead to SEA in Assagao for their Southeast Asian staples and Indian coastal dishes. Think Prawn Thoran and Bok Choy with Mushroom Stir Fry. You must try out the Onion Paniyaram which our LBB User Rene Verma calls phenomenal. There's plenty for vegetarians and for the carnivores too. The Ghee Roast Black Pepper Mutton and Stir-Fried Lobster with Ginger & Black Mushrooms get double thumbs up from us."
Prana Cafe,,"Prana Cafe, Ashwem",,,,INR 800 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+919850050403),The Rice Mill is a quaint cafe and bar in Morjim that's known for its great cocktails and jazz music. LBB Crew Akshita Zutshi says it's a must-attend for their Saturday night live jazz. The menu is focused on cafe-type meals so you'll find pasta and sandwiches along with breakfast bowls and smoothies. Their coffee and tea menu is worth checking out. Their Lemongrass and Kokum cocktails come highly recommended.
Calamari Bathe & Binge,,"Calamari Bathe & Binge, Candolim",,,,INR 800 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+917350075105),"Tucked away right at the mouth of Vaayu Waterman’s Village in Ashwem, Prana Cafe in our opinion is one of the best places that lets you enjoy a panoramic view of white sands and clear blue waters. The menu at Prana focuses on food made using locally sourced ingredients. It's heavy on the vegetarian dishes but there's tuna, chorizo, and beef if you prefer meat. Try their Avocado Sandwich, Cous Cous & Hummus Salad, and Smoothie Goji."
Fat Fish,,"Fat Fish, Baga",,,,INR 1500 without alcohol,,,,,,,,(+918806177550),"An old favourite with those holidaying in larger groups, especially families with kids, Calamari must be on your list. Not only does this one have great access to the beach, and you can meander in and out mid-meal, but the food too has been consistent. While it's not really the best food around, it's standard fare, and just what you want after water sports and wading. Think onion rings, fish fingers, chilli chicken, Goan prawn curry and rice, as well as...calamari rings. A word of caution though. While we have had good times here, and despite the wait for a table sometimes, we've always enjoyed it. But a lot of reviews on other platforms have negative feedback."
