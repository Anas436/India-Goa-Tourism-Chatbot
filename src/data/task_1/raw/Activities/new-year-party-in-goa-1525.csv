On beaches like Calangute, Dona Paula, Palolem, Baga, you'll, sure enough, find some quiet spots to have a nice bonfire and barbeque. Many locals opt for this when the city gets flooded with tourists at the clubs and popular spots.

Goa's atmosphere is perfect for a bonfire and most importantly a joyous and enjoyable one. Cooking that steak, the ham, sausages while all your friends are singing and spreading positive energy all around them. ",
